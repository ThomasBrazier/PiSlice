# PiSlice
Estimate Pi and other population genomics statistics (PiN, PiS, Tajima's D, GC content) for a given list of windows coordinates.

## Input

A txt/csv file with genomic coordinates (chromosome, start, end in basepairs) is used as a template for genomic windows in which estimate the statistics.

Depending on the statistics to compute, fasta, gff and vcf files will be processed.


## Statistics

* Pi
* PiN, PiS and PiN/PiS
* Tajima's D
* SNP density
* Gene density
* GC/GC1/GC2/GC3 content

## Output
